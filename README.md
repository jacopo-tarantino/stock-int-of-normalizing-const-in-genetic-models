Allele frequency evolution in population genetics can be framed as a filtering problem in an HMM framework. For the K-allele model, duality simplifies the task to simulating a birth-death process. We compute selection-based transition rates using Monte Carlo, nested integration, AIS, and LIS, comparing accuracy and efficiency to find the best.
